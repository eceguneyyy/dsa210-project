# Impact of Urban Heat Waves on Mortality Rates Across Major Cities  

## Project Overview
This project investigates how urban heat waves influence mortality rates across major cities, taking into account the effects of urbanization and climate patterns. As global temperatures rise, cities experience the "urban heat island" effect, where dense urban areas become significantly warmer than surrounding regions. By analyzing climate, population and heat data, this project aims to identify whether more urbanized regions face higher mortality risks during extreme heat events.

## Motivation  

Heat waves are becoming more common with climate change and can cause health problems, especially in crowded cities. Cities often stay hotter because of buildings and fewer green areas. This project studies how temperature and city size affect death rates and aims to help understand the health effects of hot weather.

## Data Sources 
- **NOAA Global Climate Data:**  
  Monthly and annual temperature anomalies, heat wave frequency, and average high temperatures for selected cities and countries.  
  [NOAA Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)  

- **World Bank Urbanization Dataset:**  
  Urban population percentage, city population density, and GDP per capita for each country.  
  [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS)  

- **WHO Mortality Database:**  
  Annual total and cause-specific mortality rates per country, including heat-related or respiratory deaths when available.

## Data Collection and Preparation
Data will be obtained from official open data portals (NOAA, World Bank, WHO) in CSV format.
Datasets will be cleaned, standardized, and merged using country or city identifiers.
The combined dataset will be used for exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling to examine the relationship between temperature anomalies, urbanization, and mortality rates.
