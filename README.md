# Impact of Air Pollution and Socioeconomic Factors on Mortality Rates Across Countries

## Project Overview
This project investigates how air pollution levels (PM2.5) and socioeconomic indicators (such as GDP per capita and health expenditure) relate to mortality rates across countries. The goal is to analyze whether countries with higher pollution and lower economic well-being experience higher mortality.

## Motivation  

I’ve recently become more curious about how air pollution and economic conditions affect public health in different countries. Since these two factors vary a lot across the world, I wanted to understand whether they play a role in mortality rates. This project gives me a chance to explore that question using real data and the tools we learned in the course.

## Data Sources 
- PM2.5 Air Pollution Data: Annual fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations for all countries. This dataset provides country-year pollution values used as the main environmental exposure variable. Collected from WorldBank.

- Income Level & Region Data: Contains country-level attributes such as income group (High, Upper-middle, Lower-middle, Low income) and geographic region classifications. These variables are used to analyze socioeconomic differences and compare mortality patterns across development levels.

- Mortality Data: Provides cause-specific and all-cause mortality estimates for each country. This dataset is used as the main health outcome variable to examine how air pollution exposure and income levels relate to mortality.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The datasets used in this project were obtained from two primary sources: the World Bank Data Portal and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).
After downloading, all datasets will be cleaned and converted into a consistent country–year structure. Country names and codes will be standardized to merge the datasets. The final merged dataset will include PM2.5 levels, income group classifications, and mortality rates for each country and year.
